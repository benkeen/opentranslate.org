TODO list
---------

MUST DO for version 1

- New versions: option to base on previous
- Reviews. It's possible that two people are reviewing the same data item at the same time. There
should be an extra check to ensure it's not already marked as "closed". If it is, let the translator know.


OPTIONAL for version 1

- If going to allow changing threshold of blacklist & trust, need to update all data when it changes.
- If going to allow REMOVING version language for translation, need to remove all translations made.
